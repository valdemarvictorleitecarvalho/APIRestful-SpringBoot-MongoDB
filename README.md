# APIRestful-SpringBoot-MongoDB

Welcome to the **APIRestful-SpringBoot-MongoDB** repository! This project demonstrates a RESTful API built with Spring Boot and MongoDB, ideal for learning and practicing backend development, NoSQL database integration, and the creation of scalable, stateless APIs.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for:

- Building a **RESTful API** using **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**.
- Practicing essential backend concepts such as **CRUD operations**, **API endpoints**, and **request/response handling**.
- Exploring **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database solution for efficient and flexible data storage.
- Learning **Spring Data MongoDB** for seamless data interaction within the Spring ecosystem.
- Implementing best practices in **API versioning**, **error handling**, and **data validation**.

## Technologies

This repository uses the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework to build a RESTful API in Java, offering powerful and easy-to-use configuration options.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database, known for its high scalability and ease of use with unstructured data.
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: Integrates MongoDB with Spring Boot, allowing efficient data manipulation with repository abstraction.
- **Java**: The core language for building and deploying the application.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions for data stored in MongoDB.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Exposes clear and structured endpoints to manage resources.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity and consistency with custom validation annotations.
- **Error Handling**: Provides custom error messages and status codes for better API usability.
- **API Versioning**: Organizes API versions to maintain backward compatibility with clients.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/APIRestful-SpringBoot-MongoDB.git
